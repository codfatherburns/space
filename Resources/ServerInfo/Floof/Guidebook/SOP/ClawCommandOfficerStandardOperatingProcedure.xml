Claw Command officers respond directly to the command on-board of the station.
Their purpose is to aid, assist, defend and sometimes serve the stations of the heads wherever possible.
In case their time is not requested by command they are encouraged to assist and help defend the crew while not staying too far away from command members.
Claw Command officers are  2nd rank command roles, they are beneath traditional command roles like the chiefs and captain, but higher than crew.
Claw Command officers follow the same SOP and escalation methods for violence, arrests and weapons as security does.
Claw Command officers should not seek to do sec's job when security has an abundant amount of officers,
it is also not standard operation for Claw Command officers to wear security belts, this should only be needed in case of a tiny security team.
