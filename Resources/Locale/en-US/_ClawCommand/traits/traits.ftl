trait-name-MindSwapPower = Partial Domination
trait-description-MindSwapPower =
    A distant relative to Telepathy, Partial Domination (or, as it's called by the less sophisticated, Mind Swap)
    allows you to use a ritual to shift your soul into someone else's body, with them getting pulled to
    the closest nearby empty shell - usually, your own. The ritual is slow, easy to prevent, and the target
    gets your psionically capable brain and can easily terminate the ability, so it's used far more often
    by bored psions looking for new experiences with their partner than any other purpose.

trait-name-HealingWordPower = Lesser Secret Of Life
trait-description-HealingWordPower =
    When the universe began, it did so with a word. You know the word, and even though it takes up a big
    part of your brain, you can speak it to whisper a bit of primordial life into someone's battered mortal shell.
    
trait-name-PsionicRegenerationPower = Overwhelming Passion for Life
trait-description-PsionicRegenerationPower =
    Your desire to continue is so strong that it overwhelms your psionic abilities, pushing your body's natural metabolism
    into overdrive. Unfortunately, it is still a psionic ability and you do still need to focus on it.
